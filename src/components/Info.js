  'I worked as a product engineer in Cadence Design System located at Shanghai, China from Jan 7th to July 5th in 2019. During that period, I built up multiple deep learning models using TensorFlow to focus on solving timing correlation problem between synthesis and posting routing steps, which are the two main stages of digital verification. The goal is to give the prediction of static timing analysis results after routing with timing data from GENUS(Front end Cadence EDA Tool) synthesis. Moreover, I participated in modifying the Tcl scripts of 5nm-level chip design, e.g. adding scripts parts for power and routing, fixing congestion and violations occured during implementation of unit case with INNOVUS (Back end Cadence EDA Tool).';

  'I developed the C++ program for generating fractal images from scratch. The functionality of the program is realized by creating a bitmap files class, a zoom class and an RGB class. The bitmap class provides functions for file i/o and setting pixels based on customized Mandelbrot set invloving color transformation using histogram. The zoom class defines functions for centering and scaling the image. The RGB class is used to define the color ranges.',

  'Developed a API with Python Flask and SQLAlchemy, which supports the sign in and sign up option with authentication functionality. This project aims to provide a api that allows users to add store/items and retrieve information from database.',

  'This is an online project focus on learning Node.js. I developed backend of this task manager app with Node.js. Users can create an account, login/out, add and update their perosnal tasks which information will be stored in MongoDB. Email will be sent to user once they create or delete their account. The API can be accessed at https://jarvis-task-manager.herokuapp.com.',

  'I built this budget web application in JavaScript, in which monthly income and expense can be listed in website with user input and an overall budget can be returned simultaneously.',

  'This is a project from applied machine learning course. I constructed the pre-processing method to binarize grayscale images with data augmentation and multiple models e.g. convolutional neural network and XGBoost in Python to achieve higher accuracy of classifying hand draw images compared to baseline such as LinearSVM.',

  'The digital circuit model of the low-noise amplifier consist of three stages: Chebyshev Filter, Cascode configuration and Buffer, with a bandwidth range of 3.1 to 10.6 GHZ  was built on ADS (Advanced Design System) and achieved an overall gain of 10dB.',
